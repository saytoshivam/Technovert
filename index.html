          Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web
          designers to occupy the space which will later be filled with 'real'
          content. This is resquired when, for example, the final text is not
          yet available. Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said
          that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when
          writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the
          melody. Dummy texts have been in use by typesetters since the 16th
          century.
